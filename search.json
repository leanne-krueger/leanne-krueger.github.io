    "text": "Nebraska football fans have always been labeled as the best in the country despite the record the team has each year. The Huskers have won a combined five national championship titles with the most recent in 1997, which was 27 years ago. Since then, the team has gone through seven head coaches, leaving us today with former Carolina Panthers coach, Matt Rhule.\nAfter high hopes of receiving former Nebraska quarterback, Scott Frost, our team and fans had hopes of making a dramatic change. Five years later, they still have that hope to an even bigger degree.\nThrough many changes in the head coach position, Matt Rhule has maintained consistency throughout his philosophies. But are we actually going to make a comeback with him?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(gt)\n\noffensepassing2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season)) \n\noffensepassing2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\noffensepassing2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\noffensepassing2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\noffensepassing2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\noffensepassing2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"OffensePassing2023.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nrushingoffense2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season)) |&gt; rename(Yards = YardsYards)\n\nrushingoffense2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nrushingoffense2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nrushingoffense2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nrushingoffense2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nrushingoffense2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"RushingOffense2023.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\nturnovermargin2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"TurnoverMargin2023.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, NameSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\noffensepassing &lt;- bind_rows(offensepassing2018, offensepassing2019, offensepassing2020, offensepassing2021, offensepassing2022, offensepassing2023)\n\nrushingoffense &lt;- bind_rows(rushingoffense2018, rushingoffense2019, rushingoffense2020, rushingoffense2021, rushingoffense2022, rushingoffense2023)\n\nturnovermargin &lt;- bind_rows(turnovermargin2018, turnovermargin2019, turnovermargin2020, turnovermargin2021, turnovermargin2022, turnovermargin2023)\n\n\npassingjoin &lt;- offensepassing |&gt; \n  select(Season, Name, NameSeason, Yards) |&gt; \n  rename(PassingYards = Yards)\n\nrushingjoin &lt;- rushingoffense |&gt; \n  select(Season, Name, NameSeason, Yards) |&gt; \n  rename(RushingYards = Yards)\n\ntotaloffense &lt;- passingjoin |&gt; \n  inner_join(rushingjoin)\n\nnu &lt;- totaloffense |&gt; filter(Name == \"Nebraska\")\n\nline1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=totaloffense, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYards, group=Name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=RushingYards, group=Name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2021.9, y=3000, label=\"Frost fired\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Rushing Yards\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n\nline2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=totaloffense, aes(x=Season, y=PassingYards, group=Name), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_line(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=PassingYards, group=Name), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2022) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2021.9, y=3000, label=\"Frost fired\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Passing Yards\") + \n  theme_minimal() \n    \n  line1 + line2  + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Rushing vs. Passing: Another Year, Another Coach\",\n    subtitle = \"A comparative look of rushing and passing yards between two different coaching staffs.\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFBStats | By LeAnne Krueger\"\n  ) & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we moving the ball more now or with Scott Frost? When looking at the difference between rushing yards and passing yards in the last five seasons, we are seeing two completely different outcomes after Frost left.\nIn 2018, the rushing yards were somewhere in the middle but took a steep drop from the 2019 season to the 2020 season. The back up and down between 2020 and 2022. When Matt entered the picture, rushing yards took a dramatic incline.\nOn the contrary, the Frost coaching staff took a dive in passing yards from 2018 until 2020 then improved from 2020 to 2021. The decline started in 2021 and didn’t stop there and has not seen improvement since the entrance of Matt Rhule.\nSo what about turnover margin?\n\n\nCode\nbig &lt;- turnovermargin |&gt; \n  group_by(Name) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    Gain = sum(`Total Gain`),\n    Lost = sum(`Total Lost`)\n  ) |&gt;\n  top_n(10, wt=Lost) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-Name,\n    names_to = \"Turnovers\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=big, aes(x=reorder(Name, Total), weight=Total, fill=Turnovers)) + \n  coord_flip() + \nscale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\",\"black\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Nebraska's Turnover Margin Isn't As Bad As You Think\",\n    subtitle = \"Huskers in the top 10 for turnover margin, but not in a way that leaves a good impression.\",\n    caption = \"Source: CFBStats | By LeAnne Krueger\",\n    x=\"\",\n    y=\"Number of Turnovers\"\n  ) + \n theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska is in the 9th spot for number of turnovers in the past five seasons. What does this mean?\nWe aren’t the worst, but we aren’t the best. This being said, it can coincide with roller coaster of rushing and passing yards. The amount of lost turnovers supports the decline in passing yards and the amount of gained turnovers supports the incline in rushing yards.\n\n\nCode\npassingaverage &lt;- offensepassing |&gt; \n  filter(Name==\"Nebraska\") |&gt;\n  select(Season, Name, `Yards/Att`) |&gt; \n  rename(PassingAverage = `Yards/Att`)\n\nrushingaverage &lt;- rushingoffense |&gt; \n  select(Season, Name, `Avg.`) |&gt; \n  rename(RushingAverage = `Avg.`)\n\naverageyards &lt;- passingaverage |&gt; \n  inner_join(rushingaverage)\n\naverageyards |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    PassingAverage = \"Passing Average\",\n    RushingAverage = \"Rushing Average\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Which Coaching Staff is Effectively Moving the Ball?\",\n    subtitle = \"The average amount of yards per play is reflecting the gradual momentum of Nebraska's offense.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** LeAnne Krueger |  **Source:** CFBStats\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(PassingAverage),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"white\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )  |&gt;\n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(RushingAverage),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"white\", \"orange\", \"red\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Coaching Staff is Effectively Moving the Ball?\n\n\nThe average amount of yards per play is reflecting the gradual momentum of Nebraska's offense.\n\n\nSeason\nName\nPassing Average\nRushing Average\n\n\n\n\n2018\nNebraska\n7.3\n5.41\n\n\n2019\nNebraska\n7.9\n4.48\n\n\n2020\nNebraska\n6.6\n4.82\n\n\n2021\nNebraska\n9.3\n4.41\n\n\n2022\nNebraska\n7.8\n3.52\n\n\n2023\nNebraska\n6.2\n4.44\n\n\n\nBy: LeAnne Krueger | Source: CFBStats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the average yards per play is important in the main question. With Rhule only being here for one season, it is hard to see it on a bigger scale. However, the averages are close together for the first year of each coach.\nComing in to rebuild a team with low standards is not an easy feat. With the improvements being represented here, is it safe to say we are in our Matt Rhule era? I think so."
